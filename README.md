# CovertChannels

This research will explore the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, and select one of these methods to perform more robust analysis. Once the method is selected, additional analysis will evaluate the general expected performance of this solution, evaluating how to establish a covert timing channel using planned delays. The research will extend to cover the bandwidth, detectability, and robustness of the channel. 

This solution will be tested in a lab environment following industry regulations. 
* Requirements: 
* Java Spring Framework
* Maven
* Java JDK
* H2 In memory Database
* Linux Machine 
* Python 
* Development work:

Setup development environment  
* Installing required dependencies such as, maven, jdk, IDE, and spring technology
* Create a REST API using Java Spring 
* Class is created in java and annotated as a controller type
* Create a Database using H2 in memory 
* Define h2 in memory database credentials in application.properties file
* Establish the timing based covert channel
* Test the solution and calculate anticipated bandwidth 
* Evaluate detection and prevention mechanisms
